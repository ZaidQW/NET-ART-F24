<h2>Harry Potter Excerpt</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>Nearly <b>ten</b> years had passed since the Dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the 
    front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed at all. The sun rose on the same tidy front 
    gardens and lit up the brass number four on the Dursleys' front door; it crept into their living 
    room, which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when Mr. Dursley had 
    seen that fateful news report about the owls. Only the photographs on the mantelpiece really
     showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots of pictures of what looked 
     like a large pink beach ball wearing different-colored bonnets - but Dudley Dursley was no 
     longer a baby, and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle, on
      a carousel at the fair, playing a computer game with his father, being hugged and kissed
       by his mother. The &nbsp;<a href="https://static.vecteezy.com/system/resources/previews/008/370/790/non_2x/empty-room-interior-for-gallery-exhibition-vector.jpg" target=”blank”>room</a>  &nbsp;
       held no sign at all that another <em>boy</em> lived in the house, too.</p>
       <br>

<p>Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep at the moment, but not for long. His 
    Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day.</p>
